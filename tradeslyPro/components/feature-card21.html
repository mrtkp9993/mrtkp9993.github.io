          Alpha factors are transformations of raw data that aim to predict
          asset price movements. They are designed to capture risks that drive
          asset returns. With TradeslyPro's Alpha Factors feature, you'll have
          access to a set of proprietary factors that help you identify patterns
          in the market and make informed investment decisions.
