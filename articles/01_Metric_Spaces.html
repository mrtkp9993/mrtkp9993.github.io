            <h2>Fundamental Definitions</h2>
            <div class="definition">
                A <em>metric space</em> is a set $S $ together with a function $d: S \times S \to [0,\infty) $
                satisfying three conditions:
                <ol>
                    <li>$d(x,y)=0 \iff x=y $,</li>
                    <li>$d(x,y)=d(y,x) $,</li>
                    <li>$d(x,z)\leq d(x,y) + d(y, z) $ (Triangle inequality).</li>
                </ol>
                The nonnegative real number $d(x,y)$ is called the <em>distance</em> between $x $ and $y $. The function
                $d $ is called a <em>metric</em> on the set $S $, also a metric space can be written as a pair $(S, d)$.
            </div>
            <div class="example">
                The set $\mathbb{R}$ of real numbers, with the function
                $$
                d(x,y)=|x-y|
                $$
                is a metric space.
            </div>
            <div class="example">
                Let d be a positive integer. Then $\mathbb{R}^d $ is the set of all ordered $d $-tuples of real numbers.
                For $x=(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_d)\in\mathbb{R}^d $ and $y=(y_1,y_2,\ldots,y_d)\in\mathbb{R}^d $, define
                <ol>
                    <li>$x\pm y=(x_1\pm y_1, x_2\pm y_2, \ldots, x_d\pm y_d) $,</li>
                    <li>$|x|=\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2+\cdots+x_d^2} $.</li>
                </ol>
                Then we define $d-$<em>dimensional Euclidean space</em> to be the set $\mathbb{R}^d $ with the metric
                $d(x,y)=|x-y| $.
            </div>
            <div class="definition"> Let $x_1,x_2,\ldots,y_1,y_2,\ldots y_d $ be 2-dimensional real numbers. Then

                $$
                \left(\sum_{j=1}^d x_j y_j\right)^2\leq\left(\sum_{j=1}^d x_j^2\right)\left(\sum_{j=1}^d y_j^2\right)

                A family $\mathcal{U}$ of subsets of $S$ is said to <em>cover</em> a set iff $A$ is contained
                in the union of the family $\mathcal{U}$. A family which covers a set is called as a <em>cover</em>
                of the set. A cover consisting of a finite number of sets is called a <em>finite cover</em>. A
                cover consisting of a countable number of sets is called a <em>countable cover</em>. An <em>open
                    cover</em>
                of a set $A $ is a cover of $A$ consisting only of open sets. If $\mathcal{U}$ is a cover of $A$,
